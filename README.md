Third Time Through - Analyzing Baseball Manager's Pitching Strategy

This project aims to analyze baseball manager's pitching strategy specifically looking at whether or not it is the right decision to remove a pitcher prior to their third time facing a batter. This project utilizes various R packages such as dplyr, baseballr, grid, and stats to analyze raw baseball data gathered from BaseballSavant and FanGraphs. You can read my entire description of the project and my findings from the project by clicking on the file in this repository.
